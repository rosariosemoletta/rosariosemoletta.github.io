        Hi, My name is Rosario, I'm from Italy and I'm very passionate about a
        lot of things.
        <br />
        CGI, VFX, videography, photography, design and.. what else?
        <br />
        Creativity is what guides me in everything I do.
        <br />
        That's all I wanted to say here, from now on I'll let my works do the
        talking.
